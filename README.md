# 'Extensive review of Benchmarking Quantum Computers'

Supervisor: Dr. Chetan Waghela, Doctoral Researcher in Quantum Optics in IIT Ropar

•	Discussed various aspects of some of such benchmarking schemes to measure power and performance of Quantum Computer.

•	Analyzed Low-level benchmarks for charactering few-qubit devices, or a few qubits at a time in a large device like Quantum State Tomography, Randomized Benchmarking.

•	Recent methods that have better scalability like Quantum Volume, Cross Entropy Benchmarking.

•	Application-oriented benchmarks that test the performance of quantum computers on practically relevant tasks like Algorithms Based Benchmarking.

•	Simulated Randomized Benchmarking code using qiskit.
